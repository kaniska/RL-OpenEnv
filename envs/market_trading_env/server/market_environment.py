Multi-Agent MarketForge - Environment Server Implementation
=============================================================
A multi-commodity market simulation with cooperation, competition,
negotiation, and coalition formation. Designed for OpenEnv v0.2.1.

Four Pillars:
  1. Cooperation  - Supply chain formation for compound goods
  2. Competition  - Continuous Double Auction with resource scarcity
  3. Negotiation  - Natural language bilateral deal-making
  4. Coalition    - Dynamic alliance formation with reputation

OpenEnv Contract
-----------------
This Environment implements the standard OpenEnv interface:

    reset(**kwargs)  -> MarketObservation
        Resets all state and returns the initial observation.
        Think of it like starting a new game -- every agent goes
        back to their starting inventory, cash, and reputation.

    step(action: MarketAction) -> MarketObservation
        Accepts ONE agent action, executes it inside the market,
        and returns the resulting observation (including reward,
        done flag, and a rich text prompt for the next decision).
        Think of it like pressing a button in a driving game:
        the agent picks an action (buy/sell/negotiate/etc.)
        and the environment moves forward one tick.

    state -> MarketState  (property)
        Returns the full server-side game state -- used for
        debugging, visualization, and evaluation but *never*
        shown to agents (they only see MarketObservation).

Scoring & Awards
-----------------
The environment tracks two distinct Awards that determine who
"wins the game":

  AWARD 1 -- Market Champion (wealth-based):
      The agent with the highest total_wealth at game end wins.
      total_wealth = cash + market_value(inventory) + compound_value

  AWARD 2 -- Master Strategist (skill-based):
      A composite score measuring *how well* the agent played:
        strategic_score = 0.35 * trade_efficiency
                        + 0.25 * negotiation_mastery
                        + 0.20 * cooperation_index
                        + 0.20 * event_adaptability

      This second award ensures that an agent who makes
      *intelligent* moves is recognized, even if another agent
      accumulated more wealth through lucky starting conditions.

Both awards are computed at game end and are returned in the
final observation so LLM agents can learn to optimize for them.

    company.  Just as a driving game gives you a steering wheel, gas, and
    brake, this environment gives each agent a clear set of *controls*:

        buy / sell      -- the gas & brake of trading

        propose/join/leave coalition -- team up with others

        pass            -- do nothing this turn

    At every step the agent receives a MarketObservation that tells it
    exactly what it can see (prices, inventory, messages, events) and
    what actions are legal.  The agent picks ONE action, the environment
    executes it, and returns a new observation + reward.

    AWARDS (two ways to win):
        Award 1 -- Market Champion: highest total wealth at game end

          - total_wealth       (cash + inventory value)
          - strategic_score    (composite quality metric)
